## Background

When working with Terraform in a team setting and utilizing remote backends, it's crucial to secure the state files that contain your infrastructure configuration. This project focuses on Azure Blob Storage as the backend of choice, demonstrating how to implement security measures and best practices to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your state files.

It is often overlooked that state files contain sensitive information, such as resource IDs, secrets, and access keys. If an attacker gains access to your state files, they can use this information to compromise your infrastructure. Therefore, it is essential to protect your state files from unauthorized access and ensure that they are encrypted at rest.

Although azurerm backends come with good defaults, it is still important to understand the security features available and how to implement them. This project aims to provide a guide and hands-on examples to help you secure your state files.

## Key Concepts

- **Access Control:** Employ Azure's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to authorized users or groups. Implement principles like least privilege, separation of duties, and credential rotation to minimize unauthorized access risks.

- **Encryption:** Secure your state files at rest by leveraging Azure Storage Service Encryption. Choose customer-managed keys (CMKs) for greater control over encryption keys, supporting key rotation and enhanced security.

- **Versioning:** Enable Azure Blob Versioning for your state files to facilitate rollbacks and recovery in case of corruption or accidental changes.

- **Backup and Redundancy:** Implement Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS) to store state files across multiple zones, ensuring accessibility and minimizing the impact of zone outages.

## Azure Integration

This project demonstrates how to integrate the mentioned security features using the azurerm backend for Azure Blob Storage. Detailed examples are provided to guide you through the setup and configuration.

## Hands-On Examples

The repository contains hands-on examples that progressively build up a secure storage account configuration. Follow these examples to implement the security features discussed in the guide and tailor it to your specific environment and requirements.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Azure subscription
- Virtual network set up with at least a P2S-VPN connection. (optional)
- Resource group, key vault, and encryption key
- Managed Identity for encryption (recommended)

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the respective example folders for detailed instructions and code samples.
3. Modify the example configuration to match your specific environment and requirements.
4. Run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` to deploy the configurations.
5. Follow the best practices mentioned in the guide for secure state file storage.
